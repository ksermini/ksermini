### 🧠 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in **data engineering**, **ETL frameworks**, and **real-time processing**. I specialize in building **modular, low-code/no-code solutions** that scale across business needs, especially in **Financial Crimes Compliance (FCC)** and investment data systems.

Right now, I’m bridging the gap between engineering and finance—applying solid software design to quantitative systems and learning everything I can about strategy, trading, and risk.

I thrive in fast-paced environments, love collaborating across teams, and believe that technical solutions should be as **elegant** as they are **effective**.

### 🛠️ What I’m Working On

- 🧬 **Event-driven, modular ETL frameworks** for real-time screening platforms  
- 💸 **Monte Carlo Option Pricing Engine** in C++ for quant dev portfolios  
- 🧠 **Sentiment analysis tools** using VADER + Twitter scraping for market signals  
- 📈 **Quantitative and fundamental data collectors** for ML-based strategy modeling  
- ⚙️ Designing pipelines that are portable, extensible, and optimized for volume-based processing

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, C++, SQL, Bash  
- **ETL / Data**: Pandas, Dask, SQLAlchemy, SSIS, Pentaho  
- **Cloud / DevOps**: Azure, Azure VMs, Azure DevOps (CI/CD), CyberArk  
- **Orchestration**: Control-M  
- **Design**: SOLID principles, OOP, metadata-driven architecture  
- **Other Tools**: Git, YAML, JSON, VS Code, GitHub Actions

### 🚀 Quick Wins

- Built a **Python-based no-code ETL engine** that dynamically transforms & delivers data based on config files—fully portable, self-documenting, and Control-M orchestrated  
- Standardized **CI/CD pipelines** across multi-stack deployments (Python, MSSQL, Java, etc.)  
- Designed a **real-time, volume-sensitive screening architecture** for new business onboarding  
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to roll out scalable solutions under tight deadlines
