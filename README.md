# üí´ About Me
Hey, I‚Äôm Kayla. I started out aiming for a cybersecurity role, fresh off a pentesting cert in Python. They told me, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt be coding much here.‚Äù Now I design and build low code and no code frameworks from the ground up. I‚Äôm basically a walking example of low code no code.
I come from a business background, but I‚Äôve always had an engineer‚Äôs mindset. I learned how companies run, what teams need, and why knowing the business matters. If you don‚Äôt know what Tim in Treasury waits an hour on every morning for his application to load, how can you build something that actually helps him?
## What I Work On
I got my start in Financial Crimes Compliance. Sounds intense? It was. I built real-time ETL pipelines, led migrations off legacy platforms, and created modular Python frameworks that turned onboarding into something fast, reusable, and even... enjoyable.
These days I‚Äôm teaching myself C++ while building a Monte Carlo option pricing engine and designing scalable data pipelines for quant strategies. It‚Äôs been a challenge in the best way ‚Äî like unlocking a new level of problem-solving.
## How I Got Here
My dad‚Äôs a senior software architect. Growing up, he taught me SOLID principles over breakfast and cloud foundations before I even knew what GitHub was. When he handed me off to learn HTML on my own, I didn‚Äôt realize it was the beginning, but I was hooked.
## What I Care About
- Systems that are clean, modular, and flexible  
- Solving the actual problem, not just the ticket  
- Code that holds up in production  
- Leading by example and building team culture  
- Making tech feel accessible ‚Äî especially for girls who haven‚Äôt seen someone like them in this space  

I was a team captain in sports before I was an engineer, and I bring that same energy to everything I do: competitive, collaborative, and committed to the win.
## Let‚Äôs Connect
If you made it this far ‚Äî thank you. Most people don‚Äôt even read the README. You probably read documentation, too. I already like you.
Let‚Äôs swap ideas, talk systems, or just chat about how to make tech more human.
